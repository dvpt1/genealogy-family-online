<h3>About the Platform</h3>

<h4>The "Family Online Genealogy" platform (hereinafter referred to as the platform) is a virtual family information database where anyone can participate in collecting and updating it from anywhere in the world.
All information is stored on your family website in genealogical cards in the CARDS folder (card file). Family member cards are not stored in .card files (e.g., 000001.card, 000002.card, etc.).
The Photos folder contains subfolders (e.g., 000001, 000002, etc.) that store photographs and copies of individual documents.
The platform is a web interface for accessing the database from web browsers.
A built-in API is available for working with the platform from applications running on Windows, Mac OS, iOS, and Android. <br /><br />

Imagine your grandmother in Canada easily adding information about her parents, your uncle in Russia sharing memories of his childhood, and your great-nephew in Turkey discovering his roots by exploring a detailed family migration map. No more storing dusty albums, sending scanned photos, or endless correspondence. You can gather it all in your own safe and convenient place.

<h4>The platform offers an intuitive interface that allows even a novice user to create and populate
a family tree. You can add biographies, photographs, copies of documents, videos, and any other materials that will help
recreate a complete picture of your ancestors' lives.</h4>

<h4>Furthermore, the platform provides powerful tools for searching and comparing data. You can
find previously unknown relatives, research historical records and documents, and connect with other genealogists
to share information and experiences.</h4>

<h4>Create your family archive today and give your descendants a priceless legacy – their family history. Let
generations be connected not only by blood, but also by a shared memory accessible anywhere in the world.

<h4>In the age of rapid digitalization, our lives are increasingly intertwined with the virtual world.
Photographs, videos, documents, correspondence, social media accounts – all of this shapes our digital

self, which, like real-life heritage, is passed down from generation to generation. But how can we preserve and transmit this digital heritage so that it doesn't disappear into the abyss of information?<br />
<br />
One of the most important aspects of preserving digital heritage is its systematization. It is necessary to create a
clear file storage structure, using folders and subfolders that logically reflect the chronology of events and the subject matter of the materials. It's also important to
select reliable cloud storage or external hard drives for data backup to avoid data loss in the event of equipment failure or hacker attacks.
<br />
<br />
Equally important is the issue of access to digital heritage after death. It's important to plan for this in advance, leaving clear
instructions and passwords for trusted individuals who can access social media accounts, email, and other
online services. It might be worth considering creating a digital will, which would outline the rules for managing
digital assets.
<br />
<br />
A family's digital heritage is more than just photographs and documents. It is the story of our lives, captured in digital format.
These are the memories we want to pass on to our descendants. By preserving and transmitting this legacy, we
ensure a connection between generations and preserve the memory of those who came before us. This is our responsibility to the future.</h4>
