<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Genealogical information is, as a rule, legally formalized and documented in appropriate standard
documents that establish kinship, family tree ties, and
family history. Establishing family tree ties requires information
on at least two generations of the family.</p>
<p>The process of collecting and analyzing genealogical information is
painstaking and requires diligence. It involves searching for and studying archival records, parish registers, confession records, census reports, and other historical documents containing information about the birth, marriage, death, place of residence, and social status of ancestors.</p>
<p>In addition to official documents, oral traditions, family legends, and photographs can be valuable sources of genealogical information. They allow us to reconstruct the lives of our ancestors and learn about their occupations, traditions, and customs. It is important to remember that oral traditions may contain inaccuracies and distortions, so they should be compared with documentary data.</p>
<p>The result of genealogical research is the creation of a family tree, which clearly displays the connections between generations of a family. The family tree can be presented as a diagram, table, or other graphical representation. It allows you to see the history of your family over time, trace the migrations of your ancestors, and identify recurring names and surnames.</p>
<p>Genealogical information has not only historical but also practical value. It can be used to confirm kinship when applying for an inheritance, establishing citizenship, or receiving social benefits. Furthermore, knowing your family tree helps you understand your identity, feel a connection to the past, and understand your place in the world.</p>
